        /* TODO Implement Dijkstras's shortest-path algorithm presented
         in the slides titled "Final Algorithm" (slide 37 or so) in the slides
         for lecture 20.
         In particular, a min-heap (as implemented in assignment A6) should be
         used for the frontier set. We provide a declaration of the frontier.
         We will make our solution to min-heap available as soon as the deadline
         for submission has passed.

         Maintaining information about shortest paths will require maintaining
         for each node in the settled and frontier sets the backpointer for
         that node, as described in the A7 handout, along with the length of the
         shortest path (thus far, for nodes in the frontier set). For this
         purpose, we provide static class SFdata. You have to declare
         the HashMap field for it and describe carefully what it
         means. WRITE A PRECISE DEFINITION OF IT.

         Note 1: Read the notes on pages 2..3 of the handout carefully.
         Note 2: The method MUST return as soon as the shortest path to node
                 end has been calculated. In that case, do NOT continue to find
                 shortest paths. You will lost 15 points if you do not do this.
         Note 3: the only graph methods you may call are these:

            1. n.getExits():  Return a List<Edge> of edges that leave Node n.
            2. e.getOther(n): n must be one of the Nodes of Edge e.
                              Return the other Node.
            3. e.length():    Return the length of Edge e.

         Method pathDistance uses one more: n1.getEdge(n2)
